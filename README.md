This repository holds my dev environment dotfiles for quick bootstrapping on new machines.

Questions are welcome. Feedback and suggestions are even more welcome.

git-prompt.sh and git-completion.sh are copied directly from [git/contrib/completion](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/).
